# type-operations

The code implements basic Math operations such as add, subtract and composition of two binary operations.

## Installation

1. Install composer following the instructions:
   (https://getcomposer.org/download/)[https://getcomposer.org/download/]

2. Run `composer install`to install necessary dependencies

## Tests

Run `vendor/bin/phpunit tests`to run tests

### Note:

As the project is small, I have used manual dependency injection control for Composition component. For bigger project the use of PHP-DI is a good idea.
